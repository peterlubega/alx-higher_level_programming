How to Select HTML Elements in JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can select HTML elements using methods such as document.getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(), and document.getElementsByTagName(). These methods allow you to target specific elements based on their ID, class, or tag name, respectively.

How to Select HTML Elements with jQuery
In jQuery, you can select HTML elements using CSS-style selectors. For example, $('selector') selects elements based on the provided CSS selector. You can use various selectors like element names, class names, IDs, attribute selectors, etc., to precisely target the desired elements.

Differences Between ID, Class, and Tag Name Selectors
ID Selector (#): Selects elements by their unique ID attribute. IDs should be unique within the HTML document.
Class Selector (.): Selects elements by their class attribute. Multiple elements can share the same class.
Tag Name Selector: Selects elements by their HTML tag name. This selector targets all elements of the specified tag type.
