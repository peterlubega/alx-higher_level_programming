Here's an overview of how to accomplish these tasks using the Python packages urllib and requests:

Fetch internet resources with the Python package urllib:

python
Copy code
import urllib.request

url = 'https://example.com'
response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
data = response.read()
Decode urllib body response:

python
Copy code
decoded_data = data.decode('utf-8')
Use the Python package requests:

python
Copy code
import requests

response = requests.get('https://example.com')
data = response.text
Make HTTP GET request:

python
Copy code
response = requests.get('https://example.com')
Make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. request:

python
Copy code
payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
response = requests.post('https://example.com/post', data=payload)
Fetch JSON resources:

python
Copy code
response = requests.get('https://example.com/data.json')
json_data = response.json()
Manipulate data from an external service:
After fetching data, you can manipulate it using Python's built-in data manipulation tools or additional libraries like Pandas or NumPy. For example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(json_data['items'])
Remember to handle exceptions and error cases appropriately in your code when working with network requests. Additionally, always ensure that you're following any usage policies or guidelines provided by the external service you're interacting with.
