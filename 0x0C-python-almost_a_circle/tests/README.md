To implement unit testing in a large project:

Organize Your Code: Structure your code in a way that promotes modularity and separation of concerns, making it easier to test individual units.

Write Test Cases: Create test cases for each unit of code. Test cases should cover both normal and edge cases to ensure thorough testing.

Use Test Frameworks: Utilize test frameworks like unittest, pytest, or nose to manage and run your tests efficiently.

Automate Testing: Set up a continuous integration (CI) system to automatically run your tests whenever code changes are made.

Mock Dependencies: When testing a unit, mock or stub external dependencies to isolate the unit and test it independently.

Serialization and Deserialization: Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process, converting the serialized data back into its original form.

In Python, you can use the pickle module for basic serialization and deserialization of objects. For more human-readable formats like JSON, you can use the json module.
